# Textbook to Lean map

Record the edition/page, exact textbook statement, Lean declaration, formal assumptions, and any intentional reformulation when each item is started.

| Textbook content | Lean declaration | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chapter 1 §1.2, Eq. (1.3), pp. 18–19: `M q̈ = F(q) = -∇U(q)` | `MolecularDynamics.NBodyEquationAt` | Implemented | Pointwise in a supplied `position` and `acceleration`. `M` is `diagonalMassMatrix masses`. No trajectory or time derivative is introduced at this stage. Mathlib's total `gradient` is used without a differentiability assumption in the definition. |
| Chapter 1 §1.2, Eq. (1.4), p. 18: `E = ∑_j m_j ‖q̇_j‖²/2 + U(q)` | `MolecularDynamics.nBodyTotalEnergy` (using `nBodyKineticEnergy`) | Implemented | With `n = N_c`, the kinetic term is expanded over scalar coordinates as `∑_i masses i * (velocity i)^2 / 2`. In 3D each particle mass is repeated for its three coordinates. |
| Theorem 1.1 | TBD | Not started | Verify statement and hypotheses before implementation. |
